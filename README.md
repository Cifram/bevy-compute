This is a plugin for the Bevy game engine to simplify use of compute shaders.

To initiate the compute shaders, first set up all the needed buffers in the `ShaderBufferSet`. Then, send a `StartComputeEvent` with a `ComputeSequence` that will define the sequence of shaders to run. If relevant, be prepared to recieve `CopyBufferEvent`, which will have buffer data returned from the computer shaders back to the CPU, and `ComputeTaskDoneEvent`, which will tell you that a given compute task has completed.
